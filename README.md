## GOAL

The goal of the project is the development of an application that integrates and elaborates data from a smartwatch. In this project the data are fecthed by the university's server Impact
The application must represent a solution for the current Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets of United Nations.
The SDG target selected is 4.7:
   
  By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, 
  among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, 
  promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultureâ€™s 
  contribution to sustainable development

## DEVELOPMENT

To develop this topic we decided to simulate a general health application with the goal to give little tips and lessons when the user reaches a set of goals (like a number of steps during a week). From the designing point of view, the application should need costant updates to stimulate the user on a longer period of time, but just for project's sake we decided to limit our development on the application's longevity and features

## DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION

The application's files can be downloaded, but it won't connect on our university server without username and password.
